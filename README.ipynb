    "An exploration into the dataset showed that sex, marriage status and education weren't importance features when predicting the default status. I found the XGboost model provided the best recall value of 0.88 for a true positive value. Precision was 0.51 and the F1 score was 0.64. Using GridsearchCV allowed me to get to the optimal parameters for XGboost to get to this recall value.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have decided that the recall value is more important when optimising the models due to the importance of being able to correctly identify actual positives, actual defaults. The precision is only 0.51, this means many customers that wouldn't be defaulting would also be identified as defaulting. The department responsible for managing risk for the credit card company would need to make a decision on what action needs to be taken. For example, if a credit card customer that isn't going to default gets flagged a letter or notification could be sent informing that in the event of difficulties making payments he/she is able to contact the customer service team see if any help can be given. This way it will be a positive interaction with the customers in general but may help prevent default before it happens to true positives for default.\n",
